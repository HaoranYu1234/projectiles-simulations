# Projectile Motion Basics

Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object that is thrown or projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity. The primary force acting on the object is gravity, which pulls it downward.

## Key Equations

When an object is launched at an angle \( \theta \) with an initial velocity \( v_0 \), its horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) motions can be described by the following equations:

### Horizontal Motion

The horizontal motion of a projectile is uniform, meaning the velocity remains constant. This is because there are no horizontal forces acting on the projectile (assuming no air resistance). The equation for horizontal motion is:

\[ x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) t \]

### Vertical Motion

The vertical motion of a projectile is influenced by the force of gravity, leading to a uniformly accelerated motion. The equation for vertical motion is:

\[ y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \]

Where:
- \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity.
- \( \theta \) is the launch angle.
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.81 m/s^2 \) on Earth).
- \( t \) is time.

## Factors Affecting Projectile Motion

1. **Initial Velocity**: The speed at which the object is launched plays a crucial role in determining how far and high it will travel.
2. **Launch Angle**: The angle at which the object is launched affects its range and height. An angle of 45 degrees usually provides the maximum range in the absence of air resistance.
3. **Gravity**: The force of gravity pulls the projectile downwards, affecting its vertical motion.
4. **Air Resistance**: In more detailed studies, air resistance can play a significant role, especially for objects moving at high speeds or for extended durations.

By understanding these basics, one can predict and analyze the motion of projectiles in various scenarios, from sports to physics experiments.
