# Projectile Motion Basics

Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object that is thrown or projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity. The primary force acting on the object is gravity, which pulls it downward.

## Key Equations

When an object is launched at an angle $\theta$ with an initial velocity $v_0$, its horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) motions can be described by the following equations:

### Horizontal Motion

The horizontal motion of a projectile is uniform, meaning the velocity remains constant. This is because there are no horizontal forces acting on the projectile (assuming no air resistance). The equation for horizontal motion is:

$$x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) t$$

### Vertical Motion

The vertical motion of a projectile is influenced by the force of gravity, leading to a uniformly accelerated motion. The equation for vertical motion is:

$$y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$$

Where:
- $v_0$ is the initial velocity.
- $\theta$ is the launch angle.
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $9.81 m/s^2$ on Earth).
- $t$ is time in seconds.

## Factors Affecting Projectile Motion

1. **Initial Velocity**: The speed at which the object is launched plays a crucial role in determining how far and high it will travel.
2. **Launch Angle**: The angle at which the object is launched affects its range and height. An angle of 45 degrees usually provides the maximum range in the absence of air resistance.
3. **Gravity**: The force of gravity pulls the projectile downwards, affecting its vertical motion.
4. **Air Resistance**: In more detailed studies, air resistance can play a significant role, especially for objects moving at high speeds or for extended durations.

By understanding these basics, one can predict and analyze the motion of projectiles in various scenarios, from sports to physics experiments.

# Projectile Motion with Air Resistance

When considering air resistance in projectile motion, the equations of motion become more complex due to the velocity-dependent drag force. Here's a detailed breakdown:

## Drag Force

The drag force, often referred to as air resistance, acting on an object moving through the air is given by:

$$ F_{drag} = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_d A $$

Where:
- $\rho$ is the air density.
- $v$ is the magnitude of the object's velocity.
- $C_d$ is the drag coefficient, which depends on the shape of the object.
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the object facing the direction of motion.

## Equations of Motion

The equations of motion can be broken down into horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) components:

### Horizontal Component

$$ m \frac{dv_x}{dt} = -F_{drag,x} $$

Where $F_{drag,x}$ is the horizontal component of the drag force and is given by:

$$ F_{drag,x} = \frac{1}{2} \rho v v_x C_d A $$

### Vertical Component

$$ m \frac{dv_y}{dt} = -mg - F_{drag,y} $$

Where $F_{drag,y}$ is the vertical component of the drag force and is given by:

$$ F_{drag,y} = \frac{1}{2} \rho v v_y C_d A $$

## Velocity Magnitude

The overall velocity magnitude is:

$$ v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} $$

## Position Update

The position of the projectile is updated based on its velocity:

### Horizontal Position

$$ x(t + \Delta t) = x(t) + v_x \Delta t $$

### Vertical Position

$$ y(t + \Delta t) = y(t) + v_y \Delta t $$

## Velocity Update

Using numerical methods, like the Euler method, the velocities are updated based on the forces acting on the projectile:

### Horizontal Velocity

$$ v_x(t + \Delta t) = v_x(t) + \frac{-F_{drag,x}}{m} \Delta t $$

### Vertical Velocity

$$ v_y(t + \Delta t) = v_y(t) + \left( \frac{-F_{drag,y}}{m} - g \right) \Delta t $$

These equations provide a comprehensive framework for simulating projectile motion with air resistance. Numerical methods are often used to solve these equations over discrete time steps due to their nonlinear nature.

# Projectile Motion with Air Resistance and Thrust

Incorporating both air resistance and thrust makes the simulation more realistic, especially for objects like rockets. Here's a detailed breakdown:

## Drag Force (Air Resistance)

The drag force, or air resistance, acting on an object moving through the air is given by:

$$ F_{drag} = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_d A $$

Where:
- $\rho$ is the air density.
- $v$ is the magnitude of the object's velocity.
- $C_d$ is the drag coefficient.
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the object.

## Constant Thrust

For scenarios where the thrust remains constant during the burn time and then drops to zero:

$$ F_{thrust} = \text{constant (during burn time)} $$

## Variable Thrust

In more advanced scenarios, thrust can vary with time. For example, a simple sinusoidal variation for thrust can be:

$$ F_{thrust}(t) = F_{max} \times \sin\left(\frac{\pi t}{burn\_time}\right) $$

Where:
- $F_{max}$ is the maximum thrust.
- $burn\_time$ is the time over which the thrust is applied.

This equation gives a thrust that starts from 0, peaks at the midpoint of the burn time, and then returns to 0 by the end of the burn time.

## Equations of Motion

The equations of motion, considering both drag and thrust, can be broken down into horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) components:

### Horizontal Component

$$ m \frac{dv_x}{dt} = F_{thrust} \cos(\theta) - F_{drag,x} $$

Where $F_{drag,x}$ is the horizontal component of the drag force:

$$ F_{drag,x} = \frac{1}{2} \rho v v_x C_d A $$

### Vertical Component

$$ m \frac{dv_y}{dt} = F_{thrust} \sin(\theta) - mg - F_{drag,y} $$

Where $F_{drag,y}$ is the vertical component of the drag force:

$$ F_{drag,y} = \frac{1}{2} \rho v v_y C_d A $$

## Velocity Magnitude

The overall velocity magnitude is:

$$ v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} $$

## Position Update

The position of the projectile is updated based on its velocity:

### Horizontal Position

$$ x(t + \Delta t) = x(t) + v_x \Delta t $$

### Vertical Position

$$ y(t + \Delta t) = y(t) + v_y \Delta t $$

## Velocity Update

Using numerical methods, the velocities are updated based on the forces acting on the projectile:

### Horizontal Velocity

$$ v_x(t + \Delta t) = v_x(t) + \left( \frac{F_{thrust} \cos(\theta) - F_{drag,x}}{m} \right) \Delta t $$

### Vertical Velocity

$$ v_y(t + \Delta t) = v_y(t) + \left( \frac{F_{thrust} \sin(\theta) - mg - F_{drag,y}}{m} \right) \Delta t $$


By incorporating both air resistance and thrust (either constant or variable), this framework provides a more comprehensive simulation of projectile motion, especially for powered projectiles like rockets. Numerical methods are essential for solving these equations due to their nonlinear nature and the time-varying nature of thrust.
